# OIBSIP_LEVEL2_TASK1
THIS IS A CALCULATOR THAT PERFORMS BASIC MATHEMATICAL OPERATIONS
Task:

The task of this code is to create a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator should be able to perform basic mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Inputs and outputs:

Input: The numbers and operators that the user enters into the calculator.
Output: The result of the mathematical operation.

Steps involved:

The code first creates a HTML page with a display area and a set of buttons.
The code then adds CSS styles to the page to make it look like a calculator.
The code then adds JavaScript code to the page to handle the user input and perform the mathematical operations.

Important concepts and techniques:

HTML: HTML is used to create the structure of the calculator page.
CSS: CSS is used to style the calculator page.
JavaScript: JavaScript is used to handle the user input and perform the mathematical operations.
Examples:

The calculator can be used to perform basic mathematical operations, such as:

Addition: 1 + 2 = 3
Subtraction: 5 - 3 = 2
Multiplication: 2 * 3 = 6
Division: 6 / 2 = 3
